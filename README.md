Automated Color Astronomical Image Processing is a project based on Python and OpenCV, aimed at automating the processing of astronomical images by integrating relevant FITS file processing libraries. The project has successfully implemented various functions, including:

* Image calibration: ensures that the observed images match the actual celestial positions, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the images.
* Noise reduction: techniques such as Gaussian noise reduction, mean noise reduction, and bilateral noise reduction effectively reduce noise in the images, improving the clarity of observational results.
* Alignment: aligns multiple images to eliminate image distortion and facilitate subsequent stacking.
* Stacking: combines multiple images to enhance the signal, making faint celestial objects easier to observe.
* Debayering: converts the original Bayer format images to RGB format images, restores image details, and improves the realism and clarity of the images.
* Automatic stretching: adjusts the image contrast to highlight details, providing more valuable data for subsequent scientific analysis.
* Automated processing: integrates the above functions to achieve one-click processing of color and black-and-white astronomical images, including noise reduction, calibration, alignment, debayering, stacking, and automatic stretching.

**Features:**

* Supports color and black-and-white astronomical image processing
* One-click processing, no manual intervention required
